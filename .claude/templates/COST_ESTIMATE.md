# [PROJECT_NAME] - Azure Cost Estimate

## Instructions for Claude Code

This template provides cost estimates for the Azure infrastructure. Populate each section by analyzing:
- The architecture document (`concept/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Infrastructure code in `concept/infrastructure/`
- The `concept/AZURE_CONFIG.json` for resource configurations
- Azure pricing calculator or pricing documentation

Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` values with actual information. Adjust scenarios based on customer's expected usage patterns. Use current Azure pricing for the deployment region.

**Key Principles:**
- Provide realistic cost ranges, not single-point estimates
- Include all resources, even small ones
- Document assumptions clearly
- Offer cost optimization recommendations
